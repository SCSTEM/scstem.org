# Computers

SC2 has several shared laptop/desktop workstations for use by all students, volunteers, or mentors. Each system has been pre-loaded with an image containing common software packages that are useful for our programs (i.e.: VSCode, various internet browsers, Java SDK, etc.). Additional software can be installed as-needed, but note that these systems will be re-imaged as-needed and installed software may not carry over.

## Laptops

Each laptop is labled as follows:

- Windows machines (yellow): `SC2-WIN-XX`
- Linux machines (red): `SC2-LINUX-XX`

Laptops not actively deployed are to be stored in a cabinet in the "Admin" room, attached to the Shop & Storage room. When stored, laptops should be plugged in with their respective chargers.

## Desktops

Coming soon (hopefully)!
