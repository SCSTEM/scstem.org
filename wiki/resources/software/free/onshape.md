# Onshape

[Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering for computer-aided-design (CAD) which runs entirely in your web browser. This is a great solution for individuals who have limited access to computers or individuals who do not have very powerful computers. Onshape also allows for powerful team-collaboration features so multiple students or educators can work on the same project at a time. They have a great [blog post](https://www.onshape.com/en/blog/how-to-onboard-your-first-robotics-team) on how Onshape can be leveraged for FIRST Robotics teams.

In addition to Onshape's first-party offerings, there are several part libraries available for commonly used FIRST Robotics components:

- [FIRST Tech Challenge](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/48f46b1b8cf1df6fc775962e/w/1f405d5721c52faf30bdedca/e/32cd80978653af997ac758d6?renderType=V3_UI&retryErrorScreen=1#_ga=2.242172676.724212230.1631538582-1534852491.1623175984), [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP3pT9OsiW8&list=PLOPIJtr7Kd_4fWM4k3pIYLE6qnFJXDeSE&t=380s).
