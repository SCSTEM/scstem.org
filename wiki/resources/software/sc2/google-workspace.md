# üîê Google Workspace

:::info

Google Workspace accounts are not limited in quantity, but are limited in distribution. Please reach out to a board member on Slack if you need an account.

:::

## Mail

Individual mailboxes for all BoD members and specific volunteers and students who are working with SC2 in a bigger capacity. Emails follow the following format: [first name]@scstem.[org/tech] and email aliases can be added upon request. Shared accounts will be available in situations where necessary (e.g.: `big-group@scstem.org`) which can be passed between individuals.

Everyone who has an account is encouraged to use (and check) their SC2 account for all SC2 communications. This helps keep what we are doing organized and on-topic.

## Calendar

SC2 calendars are shared to specific users/groups, so head to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com) with your SC2 account to see what calendars you are a part of. The public SC2 calendar is available [here](/calendar).

## Docs

Most of our documentation (where possible) should be performed in Google Docs. To keep things simple and standardized, there are several templates available within Google Workspace.

Current, hopefully updated, list of templates:

- **SC2 Base:** Blank document with SC2 logo and contact info for general use
- **Board Meeting Notes:** Meeting notes template with SC2 logo and contact info

## Drive

Each user gets 30GB of Google Drive storage which includes the ability to create Shared Drives which can be shared with users internal and external to SC2. Shared Drives are generally better than Shared Folders when needing to have a drop-point or shared folder between many different users. For example, a Media drive for all pictures/video from competitions.

Shared drives are shared to specific users/groups. These shared drives can be accessed in your Google Drive sidebar.

## Meet

Although Google Meet meetings didn‚Äôt seem to have a time limit before, they definitely do not have a limit now. All official SC2 meetings will be migrated to Google Meet and users can create Google Meet meetings without time limits for their clubs. Additionally, we have a dial-in phone number associated with any meetings created.

## Sites

Most users will have the ability to create and publish Google Sites sites. Google Sites is an easy drag and drop site builder, which makes it easy to quickly create a website. Individual sites are great for students to showcase projects or SC2 to segment our online presence. Custom URLs (i.e.: example.scstem.org) are available upon request.
