# AmazonSmile

[AmazonSmile](https://smile.amazon.com/charity/smile/about) is a free and easy way to support your favorite charities and non-profits at no cost to you! By simply selecting _South Central STEM Collective_ as your charity, Amazon will donate 0.5% of every purchase you make to us. Although this sounds small, it is by no means insignificant and every little bit helps!

## FAQ

**Q: How much does SC2 get from each purchase?**

**A:** Amazon will donate 0.5% of every purchase directly to SC2.

**Q: What does SC2 do with the money received from AmazonSmile?**

**A:** This money helps cover utility expenses such as internet and electricity, which support all of our clubs!

## Setup

Below are instructions for setting up AmazonSmile on your computer and your mobile device. Be sure to follow both sets of steps (Website _and_ Mobile) if you use both for shopping, as turning one on does not turn on the other.

### Website

1. Go to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com) in your favorite internet browser.

:::note
If you already have AmazonSmile set up for another charity and you want to switch your charity to us, simply open the AmazonSmile dropdown and press **Change**.

2. If you do not have AmazonSmile already set up, it will ask you to search for a charity. Just type in `South Central STEM Collective` and press **Search**.

3. Select _South Central STEM Collective_ from the list.

4. And that's it! Just make sure anytime you make a purchase through Amazon, you are going to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com) and not amazon.com.

:::tip
If you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge, there is a great Extension/Add-on called _AmazonSmile Redirect_ which will automatically redirect your browser to AmazonSmile whenever you visit.

- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-smile-redirect/ejglonclnjogoiegggjjcpapffbnangg?hl=en)
- [Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon_smile_redirect/)
- [Edge Add-on Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/amazon-smile-redirect/ojfbbnlijdmckaehmhlnjgmpnbhjjibn)

_Disclaimer: This is a 3rd-party add-on and is not supported by SC2. Please report any issues to the developer directly. If this add-on ever goes unmaintained or is hijacked, feel free to [get in touch](/webmaster)._
