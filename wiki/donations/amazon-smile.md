# Amazon Smile

[Amazon Smile](https://smile.amazon.com/charity/smile/about) is a free and easy way to support your favorite charities and non-profits at no cost to you! By simply selecting _South Central STEM Collective_ as your charity, Amazon will donate 0.5% of every purchase you make to us. Although this sounds small, it is by no means insignificant and every little bit helps! Below are instructions for getting started with both the Amazon website and the mobile app:

## Website

1. Go to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com) in your favorite internet browser.

:::note
If you already have Amazon Smile set up for anothe r charity and you want to switch your charity to us, simply open the Amazon Smile dropdown and press **Change**.

3. Select _South Central STEM Collective_ from the list.

4. And that's it! Just make sure anytime you make a purchase through Amazon, you are going to [smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com) and not amazon.com.
