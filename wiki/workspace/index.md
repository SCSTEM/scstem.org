## Directions

We are located in the Chambersburg Mall, off Black Gap Road. Getting to our unit from outside the mall can be slightly tricky, so please refer to these directions.

1. Access the mall property using the "secondary" mall entrance near the Dollar General <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" strokeWidth="1.5" stroke="white" style={{width: "1.5rem"}}><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" fill="red" d="M19.5 10.5c0 7.142-7.5 11.25-7.5 11.25S4.5 17.642 4.5 10.5a7.5 7.5 0 1115 0z" /><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" fill="white" d="M15 10.5a3 3 0 11-6 0 3 3 0 016 0z" /></svg>.
2. Drive straight into the parking lot, on the left side of the divider (Yellow area).
3. Our entrance is right beside a glass door. Note the image attached to the SC2 Bulb marker.
