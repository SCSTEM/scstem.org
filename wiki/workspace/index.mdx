# Workspace

## Directions

Our main workspace is located in downtown Chambersburg at 20 South Main Street.

1. Parking for our space is off of South Central Avenue, behind the main Chambersburg square. Google Maps generally takes you to the right spot with the following address: [`20 S  Main St, Chambersburg, PA 17201`](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HEVNznVzjixQSrL26).
   - Note: The parking lot is shared with other tenants. Please only park in spots: 1-12, 18-24, or 29-42.
2. After parking, please enter through the doors pictured below.
