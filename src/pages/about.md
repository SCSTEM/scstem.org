# About Us

The South Central STEM Collective (otherwise known as SC2) was created to serve South Central Pennsylvania as "STEM Central" to inspire youth aged K-12 through hands-on education, competitive robotics and drone teams, maker spaces, and community outreach.

Although still in the early stages, SC2 has big plans to help students excited about science, engineering, technology, art, and more. Whether on the road to a high-school robotics competition or working hard with younger students excited about Lego projects, SC2 is here to help students as they explore their futures.

## History

To understand where SC2 is going, it is equally important to understand where SC2 came from. For this reason, it is important to start at the beginning: Biohazard.

### 1. Biohazard

The Biohazard 4050 FIRST Robotics Competition team was formed in early 2012, ready to compete but not sure what the future held.

When Biohazard 4050 began on January 7th of 2012, most of the initial members and volunteers didn’t quite know what they were getting into.

Being part of a FIRST FRC Robotics team is quite a challenge. During the team’s rookie year, Biohazard 4050 participated in Rebound Rumble with their first robot creation, Genesis. The small group learned just how fun and rewarding the experience of FIRST could be.

The following year, the team was fortunate enough to grow in students and mentors. With a bit more knowledge and preparation, the group readied themselves for the epic Ultimate Ascent challenge, and took their robot, Total Meltdown, to two competitions!

By the third year, the team’s skills had developed even further. When presented with the Aerial Assist challenge, Biohazard 4050 responded with the legendary robot “Toxic Lepra-Khan” (signed by Dean Kamen!). At the FIRST FRC Greater Pittsburgh Regional Competition, Biohazard 4050 made it to the quarterfinals and won the EXCELLENCE IN ENGINEERING AWARD!

In 2015, the students of Biohazard are proving to be unstoppable! The group has grown in strength and numbers, and the members have honed and polished their skills and positions even further. With the 2015 season underway, the team is hard at work crafting its latest robot for the Recycle Rush challenge! We can’t wait to see you at the Greater Pittsburgh Regional Competition and the Chesapeake Regional Competition!

What the team did not realize in 2015 was that a 2016 regional competition win was right around the corner, with Biohazard finally making it to world championships in St. Louis, Mi. This excitement and energy carried the team through 4 more years of location changes, new students joining and older students moving on to careers or college, 4 more robots, and the constant challenge of being the best FRC team they could be.

### 2. 2020 and beyond

2020 was an interesting year for everyone in many different ways. For Biohazard, the year started the same way it always had. An exciting kickoff event in early January, followed by several weeks of robot building. At the end of February, the team made it to their first competition at Myrtle Beach, SC. It was a tough challenge and the team realized that there were several improvements to the robot design that had to take place before their next event in Pittsburgh, PA. Unfortunately, those few weeks between events saw the world change completely. The team never got to compete later that year in 2020 and would not get to return to a regional event until 2022.

With everyone stuck at home, still feeling the itch for competition and realizing the passion the students had, an idea started forming: "Why couldn't we break away from 4-H and start our own program?" At first glance, this question might seem counterproductive, as the Biohazard website said:

> The students of Biohazard 4050 are not only members of FIRST, but are also members of the Franklin County (PA) 4-H Program. Their dual membership gives them a unique perspective and opportunities for local service and outreach within their community. The student’s dedication to each other and their commitment to their community is a testimony to their character, service, and leadership skills. The volunteers and mentors of Biohazard 4050 are very proud of the students, and honored to be a part of their experiences!
