The Biohazard 4050 FIRST Robotics Competition team was formed in early 2012, ready to compete but not sure what the future held. With humble beginnings in the basement of a 4-H extension office, a collection of used tools, a few hand-me-down computers, and a handful of excited students, the team was gearing up to compete.

When Biohazard 4050 began on January 7th of 2012, most of the initial members and volunteers didn’t quite know what they were getting into.

Being part of a FIRST FRC Robotics team is quite a challenge. During the team’s rookie year, Biohazard 4050 participated in Rebound Rumble with their first robot creation, Genesis. The small group learned just how fun and rewarding the experience of FIRST could be.

The following year, the team was fortunate enough to grow in students and mentors. With a bit more knowledge and preparation, the group readied themselves for the epic Ultimate Ascent challenge, and took their robot, Total Meltdown, to two competitions!

By the third year, the team’s skills had developed even further. When presented with the Aerial Assist challenge, Biohazard 4050 responded with the legendary robot “Toxic Lepra-Khan” (signed by Dean Kamen!). At the FIRST FRC Greater Pittsburgh Regional Competition, Biohazard 4050 made it to the quarterfinals and won the EXCELLENCE IN ENGINEERING AWARD!

In 2015, the students of Biohazard are proving to be unstoppable! The group has grown in strength and numbers, and the members have honed and polished their skills and positions even further. With the 2015 season underway, the team is hard at work crafting its latest robot for the Recycle Rush challenge! We can’t wait to see you at the Greater Pittsburgh Regional Competition and the Chesapeake Regional Competition!

What the team did not realize early on in 2015 was that a regional competition win was right around the corner, with Biohazard finally making it to world championships in St. Louis, Mi. This excitement and energy carried the team through 4 more years of location changes, new students joining and older students moving on to careers or college, 4 more robots, and the constant challenge of being the best FRC team they could be.
